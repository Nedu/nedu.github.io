Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. My contact information can be found at the contact section of my website.

#### About Myself

I am a full-stack developer dedicated to acquiring the best web practices. With a strong foundation on being self-sufficient in my learning, I have built a variety of web applications using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, React, Redux, NodeJs, Express, and MongoDB. I have a solid understanding in creating and consuming front-end APIs. With this knowledge I have built dynamic web applications such as a blog platform app and Wikipedia viewer. I am also adept in responsive web design. My portfolio page utilizes the Gatsby static site generator in combination with GraphQL and a responsive UI.

#### My Recent Projects

I am most familiar working with NodeJs, Express and mongoDB in the back end, and HTML5, CSS3, Javascript React and Redux in the front end. Some other frameworks and libraries that I use include Bootstrap, MeteorJS, Flask and jQuery. I also use Github for version control, Heroku for app deployment in a cloud platform, and stylesheet preprocessors such as Sass and LESS. I'm currently working on a personal project where I am creating 100 web apps as a way to showcase my skills and abilities. 

#### What I'm looking for

I have a strong desire to grow as a developer and I want to work for a company that embraces learning. While I would be most comfortable to work at a place which employs the technologies I am familiar with, I am a fast learner and can easily pick up languages and frameworks quickly and would be happy to acquire new skills and knowledge. I am interested in full-stack positions, particularly when they deal with things like big data, data visualization, and data science.
